Introduction
This project develops a deep learning model to investigate the association between m6A sites and functional elements (ORFs/IRES/RBP/miRNA) in circRNA. The workflow involves R-based preprocessing followed by training and interpretation using the SRAMP model.

Step 1: Extract ORFs with TransDecoder

bash

TransDecoder.LongOrfs -t circrna_positive.fasta

TransDecoder.LongOrfs -t circrna_negative.fasta

Generates longest_orfs.cds.

Step 2: Align Sequences with R

Load circrna_positive.rds and align ORF sequences.Match ORFs to m6A sites in m6a_circ_olp.rds.

r 

circrna_positive <- readRDS("circrna_positive.rds")

orf_sequences <- readDNAStringSet("longest_orfs.cds")

circrna_negative <- readRDS("circrna_negative.rds")

orf_sequences <- readDNAStringSet("longest_orfs.cds")

overlaps <- findOverlaps(m6a_circ_olp, circrna_pos)

overlaps <- findOverlaps(m6a_circ_olp_neg, circrna_neg)

Determine:

Whether the m6A lies inside ORFs.

Distance between m6A and both ends of ORFs.

Step 3: Check Overlap with IRES

r

overlap_results_pos <- findOverlaps(m6a_circ_olp_updated, ires_granges)

overlap_results_neg <- findOverlaps(m6a_circ_olp_neg_updated, ires_granges)

Step 4: Check Overlap with RBP

r
rbp <- readRDS("RBP_site_gr_38.rds")

rbp_list <- c("HNRNPC","YTHDC1","YTHDF1","YTHDF2","METTL3","METTL14",
              "METTL16","WTAP","ALKBH5","FTO")
              
Step 5: Overlap with miRNA Sites

r

miRNA_ALL_gr <- readRDS("miRNA_ALL_gr.rds")

mcols(m6a_circ_olp_updated)$miRNA <- FALSE

overlaps <- findOverlaps(m6a_circ_olp_updated, miRNA_ALL_gr)

mcols(m6a_circ_olp_updated)$miRNA[queryHits(overlaps)] <- TRUE

Step 6: Feature Preprocessing (preprocess_m6A_features.R)

Output includes:

score_matrices_*.npy

phenotype_features_*.npy

labels_*.npy

Final Workflow Summary

Train model via train.py.

Visualize SHAP feature importance via shap_analysis.py.

Analyze positive and negative samples separately.

Evaluate using metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and F1 score.
